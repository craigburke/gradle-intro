= HACKING asciidoctor-reveal.js

To understand what you have access to in templates, just inject some ruby.
For example to see which attributes are available, you can print them using:

----
- puts @document.attributes.inspect
- puts @attributes.inspect
----

Other generally useful introspection:

----
- puts instance_variables
- puts local_variables
- puts @document.methods
----

One might find `pp` to produce better output (and in some cases not).

----
- require 'pp'
- pp @document.attributes
----
